# About lightware-VM

Lightware-VM is a cutting-edge virtual machine emulator system designed to support multiple backends (QEMU, VirtualBox, VMware, Parallels) with advanced AI integration using ChatGPT with me,i am the leader.Lightware featuring a custom virtual disk format is vdi2x(stand for Virtual Disk Image â€“ Second Generation Extended), support for up to 100 virtual CPUs, and multi-platform compatibility (Windows, macOS, Linux), Lightware-VM redefines virtualization management with intelligent automation, user-friendly Qt GUI, and flexible scripting tools.
Now is currently in WIP so stay tuned
